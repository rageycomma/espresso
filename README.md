# README #

Espresso is a highly-opionionated, agitating, loudmouth brawler of a HTTP server. Based upon RxJS and Observables, and taking away all the unnecessary middleware which is installed, which should be basic functionality. 

# WARNING # 
Tests and all the rest will be implemented soon, and this repo will move to GitHub as soon as a 0.1.0 release is done. 

Cheers.
